<h2>The Problem</h2>
<div id="theProblem" style="color:darkslategray">Berkeley, California has an estimated population of 1,100 homeless people
    and this number continues to rise. While homeless women make up about the same percentage of the homeless
    population as men, they are rarely recognized or even counted in homeless statistics. Most homeless women
    stay in a car or couch surf because staying on the street is too dangerous. On top of not having a safe place
    to stay or access to resources, homeless women have to face the dangers of being a woman, which are further
    amplified by their situation. Many homeless women are victims of domestic violence, sexual harm, drug abuse,
    health issues, and mental health illnesses. Not only do these women have to care for themselves, but some of
    them have children to care for as well. In addition, many homeless women do not have access to necessary hygiene
    products (such as pads, tampons, and soap) or health services (such as medicine, check ups, and rehabilitation).
    Despite everything that homeless women go through, their experiences are rarely acknowledged or discussed. This
    leads to homeless women becoming invisible in the eyes of the rest of the population, which causes their problems
    to be ignored. We have found that while there are many projects and systems of support for the homeless, there are
    few aimed to help women.

<h2>Our Goal</h2>
<div id="ourGoal" style="color:darkslategray">The goal of Women Helping Women, is to create a platform where the experiences
    of homeless women in Berkeley can be documented, acknowledged, and shared. We want to create a community that unites all
    women of berkeley.
